## Tool reference

### `kirograph_context`: **start here for any code task**

Returns entry points, related symbols, and code snippets for a natural-language task description. Usually enough to orient without any additional tool calls.

```
kirograph_context(task: "fix the auth token expiry bug")
kirograph_context(task: "add dark mode", maxNodes: 30)
kirograph_context(task: "refactor payment service", includeCode: false)
```

### `kirograph_search`: find symbols by name

Exact match → FTS → LIKE fallback → vector (last resort). Use instead of grep.

```
kirograph_search(query: "signIn")
kirograph_search(query: "UserService", kind: "class")
kirograph_search(query: "auth", limit: 20)
```

Supported kinds: `function`, `method`, `class`, `interface`, `type_alias`, `variable`, `route`, `component`

### `kirograph_node`: inspect a symbol

Returns kind, file, signature, docstring. Add `includeCode: true` to get the full source.

```
kirograph_node(symbol: "validateToken")
kirograph_node(symbol: "AuthService", includeCode: true)
```

### `kirograph_callers`: who calls this?

BFS over incoming `calls` edges (depth 1).

```
kirograph_callers(symbol: "processPayment", limit: 30)
```

### `kirograph_callees`: what does this call?

BFS over outgoing `calls` edges (depth 1).

```
kirograph_callees(symbol: "handleRequest")
```

### `kirograph_impact`: blast radius before a change

Traverses all incoming edges up to `depth` hops. Call this before editing a symbol.

```
kirograph_impact(symbol: "UserRepository", depth: 3)
```

### `kirograph_path`: how are two symbols connected?

BFS shortest path across all edge types.

```
kirograph_path(from: "LoginController", to: "DatabasePool")
```

### `kirograph_type_hierarchy`: class/interface inheritance

```
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "BaseRepository", direction: "down")  // derived types
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "PaymentService", direction: "up")    // base types
kirograph_type_hierarchy(symbol: "IUserStore", direction: "both")      // all
```

### `kirograph_dead_code`: unreferenced symbols

Returns unexported symbols with zero incoming edges. Good first step when cleaning up.

```
kirograph_dead_code(limit: 50)
```

### `kirograph_circular_deps`: import cycles

Runs Tarjan's SCC over import edges. No parameters needed.

```
kirograph_circular_deps()
```

### `kirograph_files`: indexed file structure

```
kirograph_files(format: "tree")                          // default
kirograph_files(format: "flat")                          // one path per line
kirograph_files(format: "grouped")                       // by directory
kirograph_files(filterPath: "src/auth", maxDepth: 2)
kirograph_files(pattern: "**/*.test.ts")
```

### `kirograph_status`: index health

Returns file count, symbol count, edge count, embedding coverage, DB size. Call when something feels off.

### `kirograph_hotspots`: most-connected symbols

Returns the top-N symbols by total edge degree (in + out, excluding structural `contains` edges). Use to find core abstractions, identify high blast-radius symbols before a refactor, or understand what the codebase revolves around.

```
kirograph_hotspots(limit: 20)
```

### `kirograph_surprising`: unexpected cross-module coupling

Finds direct edges between symbols in structurally distant files, scored by path distance × edge-kind weight. Use before a refactor to discover hidden dependencies that will break. High score = more unexpected.

```
kirograph_surprising(limit: 20)
```

### `kirograph_diff`: what changed since a snapshot?

Compares the current graph against a saved snapshot. Shows added/removed symbols and edges. A snapshot must exist: the user saves one with `kirograph snapshot save <label>` before making changes.

```
kirograph_diff()                              // vs latest snapshot
kirograph_diff(snapshot: "pre-refactor")     // vs named snapshot
```

---

## Architecture tools *(require `enableArchitecture: true` in config)*

### `kirograph_architecture`: **start here for architectural questions**

Returns the full package graph, detected layers (api/service/data/ui/shared), and their dependency edges.

```
kirograph_architecture()                    // packages + layers
kirograph_architecture(level: "packages")
kirograph_architecture(level: "layers")
kirograph_architecture(includeFiles: true)  // add file→package assignments
```

### `kirograph_coupling`: stability metrics per package

Returns Ca (afferent: depended on by), Ce (efferent: depends on), and instability (Ce/(Ca+Ce)).
- High Ca + low instability = load-bearing, safe to depend on, risky to change interface.
- High Ce + high instability = depends on many things, safe to refactor internals.

```
kirograph_coupling()                        // all packages, sorted by instability
kirograph_coupling(sortBy: "afferent")     // most depended-on first
kirograph_coupling(sortBy: "efferent")     // most outgoing deps first
```

### `kirograph_package`: drill into one package

Returns metadata, coupling metrics, outgoing deps, incoming dependents, and file list.

```
kirograph_package(package: "auth")
kirograph_package(package: "src/services", includeFiles: false)
```

## Workflows

**Bug fix or feature:**
1. `kirograph_context`: orient, find entry points.
2. `kirograph_node` with `includeCode: true`: read the relevant symbol.
3. `kirograph_callers` / `kirograph_callees`: trace the call flow.
4. `kirograph_impact`: check blast radius before editing.

**Refactor planning:**
1. `kirograph_hotspots`: identify the most-connected symbols; changing these is risky.
2. `kirograph_surprising`: surface hidden coupling that will break.
3. `kirograph_impact` on specific targets: confirm blast radius.
4. `kirograph_diff` after the refactor: verify the structural change matches intent.

**Architectural review:**
1. `kirograph_architecture`: get the package and layer map.
2. `kirograph_coupling`: find the most stable (high Ca) and most volatile (high instability) packages.
3. `kirograph_package`: drill into any package of interest.
4. `kirograph_circular_deps`: check for import cycles.

**Code cleanup:**
1. `kirograph_dead_code`: find unreferenced unexported symbols.
2. `kirograph_circular_deps`: find import cycles to untangle.
3. `kirograph_surprising`: find unexpected coupling to decouple.

## Workflow steering files

KiroGraph installs task-specific steering files in `.kiro/steering/`. They are not always active — load them on demand.

**In Kiro IDE:** type `/kirograph-review`, `/kirograph-security`, etc. to activate a workflow for the current session.

**In Kiro CLI / other agents:** when the user asks for a specific workflow or you recognize the intent, read the file directly:

```
Read file: .kiro/steering/kirograph-security.md
Read file: .kiro/steering/kirograph-review.md
```

| User intent | File to load |
|-------------|-------------|
| security audit, check vulnerabilities, CVE review | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-security.md` |
| code review, review this PR | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-review.md` |
| debug, trace this bug, root cause | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-debug.md` |
| architecture, understand structure, package map | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-architecture.md` |
| onboard, understand this codebase | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-onboard.md` |
| refactor, rename, safe refactoring | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-refactor.md` |
| memory, recall decisions, conflict detection | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-mem-workflow.md` |
| wiki, update knowledge base, ingest docs | `.kiro/steering/kirograph-wiki-workflow.md` |

Each file contains numbered steps, exact tool calls, and an interpretation reference. Follow the steps in order.

## Shell Compression (\`kirograph_exec\`)

When running shell commands, prefer \`kirograph_exec\` over raw shell execution for:
- **git** operations (status, log, diff, push, pull, commit, add, fetch, branch)
- **GitHub CLI** (gh pr list/view, gh issue list, gh run list)
- **test runners** (jest, vitest, pytest, cargo test, go test, rspec, minitest, playwright)
- **linters/build** (eslint, tsc, ruff, clippy, cargo build, prettier, biome, golangci-lint, rubocop, next build)
- **file listings** (ls, find, tree)
- **search** (grep, rg/ripgrep: grouped by file)
- **diff** (diff file1 file2: condensed context)
- **docker/k8s** (docker ps, images, logs, compose ps, kubectl pods, logs, services)
- **package managers** (npm/pnpm install/list, pip list/install, bundle install, prisma generate)
- **AWS CLI** (sts, ec2, lambda, logs, cloudformation, dynamodb, iam, s3, ecs, sqs, sns)
- **network** (curl, wget: strip progress bars and headers)

This saves 60-90% of tokens compared to raw output.

Compression level: **normal**: Balanced: removes noise, keeps structure.

\`\`\`
kirograph_exec(command: "git status")
kirograph_exec(command: "npm test")
kirograph_exec(command: "cargo build")
kirograph_exec(command: "ls -la src/")
\`\`\`

**Important:** Error details are always preserved. Failed commands show full diagnostic output regardless of level.

**Do NOT re-run commands:** When \`kirograph_exec\` returns a result, treat it as the final answer. Never re-run the same command with raw shell execution to "get more details." The compressed output preserves all essential information. If you genuinely need something missing from the output, explain what's missing before making a second call.

Use \`kirograph_gain\` to check token savings statistics.

---

## If `.kirograph/` does NOT exist

Ask the user: "This project doesn't have KiroGraph initialized. Run `kirograph init -i` to build a code knowledge graph for faster exploration?"

## Memory

KiroGraph has persistent memory. Use it to recall past decisions and store new ones.

| Question | Tool |
|----------|------|
| What did we decide about X? | `kirograph_mem_search` |
| Store a decision / bug fix / pattern | `kirograph_mem_store` |
| Does this contradict something stored? | `kirograph_mem_conflicts_scan` |
| Two observations conflict — which wins? | `kirograph_mem_compare` → `kirograph_mem_judge` |
| Extract observations from structured text | `kirograph_mem_capture` |
| Which observations need re-evaluation? | `kirograph_mem_review` |
| Mark an observation as still valid | `kirograph_mem_mark_reviewed` |

Memory is searchable via hybrid FTS + vector search. Observations surface automatically in
`kirograph_context` and `kirograph_impact` results when linked to relevant code symbols.

**When to store:** After fixing a bug, making an architecture decision, discovering a pattern,
or learning something future sessions should know. One fact per store call. A hook reminds you
at session end.

**topicKey:** Use a stable semantic key (e.g. `"architecture/auth-model"`) when storing a
decision that may be superseded or revisited. Lets you address the same concept across sessions.

**reviewAfter:** Pass an epoch-ms timestamp when an observation should expire or be re-evaluated
(e.g. after a planned migration, a library upgrade, or a time-boxed experiment).

For the full conflict-detection workflow, load: `.kiro/steering/kirograph-mem-workflow.md`

## Documentation

KiroGraph indexes project documentation by heading structure. Use `kirograph_docs_search`
to find relevant doc sections instead of reading entire files. Use `kirograph_docs_section`
to retrieve the exact section you need by ID.

**Available tools:**
- `kirograph_docs_toc` — table of contents for a file or the whole project
- `kirograph_docs_search` — search sections by query (independent from code search)
- `kirograph_docs_section` — retrieve full content of a section by ID
- `kirograph_docs_outline` — heading hierarchy for a single document
- `kirograph_docs_refs` — find code symbols referenced by a doc section (or vice versa)

**When to use:** Before reading a documentation file directly, check if `kirograph_docs_search`
or `kirograph_docs_outline` can give you the specific section you need. This saves tokens
and gives you structured navigation instead of raw file content.

## Data

KiroGraph indexes tabular data files (CSV, TSV, JSONL, JSON, Excel, Parquet) for structured
querying. Use `kirograph_data_describe` to understand a dataset's schema without loading
the file. Use `kirograph_data_query` with filters to retrieve specific rows.

**Available tools:**
- `kirograph_data_list` — list all indexed datasets with row/column counts
- `kirograph_data_describe` — full schema profile: column names, types, cardinality, null%, samples
- `kirograph_data_query` — filtered row retrieval with structured operators (eq, gt, contains, in, between)
- `kirograph_data_aggregate` — server-side GROUP BY: count, sum, avg, min, max, count_distinct
- `kirograph_data_search` — search column names and sample values by keyword

**When to use:** Instead of reading a CSV/data file directly (which floods context with raw rows),
use `kirograph_data_describe` to understand the schema, then `kirograph_data_query` with
filters to get only the rows you need. For summary statistics, use `kirograph_data_aggregate`
to compute results server-side. This saves 95-99% of tokens compared to reading raw data files.

```
kirograph_data_list()
kirograph_data_describe(dataset: "tests-fixtures-users")
kirograph_data_query(dataset: "tests-fixtures-users", filters: [{column: "role", op: "eq", value: "admin"}])
kirograph_data_aggregate(dataset: "data-orders", groupBy: ["region"], metrics: [{column: "amount", op: "sum"}])
```

## Pattern Matching

KiroGraph can search for structural code patterns using @ast-grep/napi.

**Available tools (only when enablePatterns: true and @ast-grep/napi installed):**
- `kirograph_live_search` — search for any AST pattern across the codebase at query time

**CLI commands:**
- `kirograph pattern "<pattern>"` — live structural search
- `kirograph pattern --list` — browse bundled SAST rules
- `kirograph pattern --library <id>` — run a specific library rule

**When to use:** When you need to find code patterns that can't be expressed as symbol names or semantic queries — "all eval() calls", "all SQL string concatenation", "all readFile with request parameters".

## General-purpose compression

`kirograph_compress` is an on-demand tool for reducing token usage before content reaches the model.
Call it whenever you receive large input that you need to reason over but not reproduce verbatim.

**Two engines — auto-routed by the `command` parameter:**

| Scenario | Call |
|----------|------|
| Paste of shell output (git log, npm install, test run, docker ps…) | `kirograph_compress(text: "...", command: "git log")` |
| Prose text, RAG chunk, observation, or mixed content | `kirograph_compress(text: "...")` |

- **With `command`:** rtk-style structural filters — pattern-matched to the command family (git, test, lint, docker, etc.), removes noise, deduplicates repeated lines, keeps structure.
- **Without `command`:** caveman grammar — removes filler words, articles, hedging phrases, and (at ultra level) applies standard abbreviations. Preserves code blocks, paths, URLs, and identifiers unchanged.

**Compression levels** (same enum for both engines):
- `lite` / `normal` — light touch: remove noise and filler only
- `full` / `aggressive` — default: also remove articles, hedging, group repeated output
- `ultra` — maximum: abbreviations, causality arrows (→), conjunction compression (+)

**When to use:**
- You received a large file diff, log dump, or search result and only need the structure
- You want to store an observation in memory and the text is verbose
- A tool output is close to or over budget and you need to trim before reasoning

**When NOT to use:**
- Content that must be reproduced exactly (code to be written to disk, user quotes)
- Short content (< 200 tokens) — overhead not worth it
- Already-compressed output (kirograph_exec already applies rtk filters automatically)

**Savings are reported inline:** `[42% saved | 1800→1044 | rtk:git:aggressive]`

## Wiki

KiroGraph maintains a structured LLM wiki — a set of markdown pages that compound knowledge
across sessions. Use it to look up project decisions, architecture facts, and domain knowledge
before starting work. Use it to save knowledge that should survive context resets.

**Available tools:**
- `kirograph_wiki_ingest` — build an ingest prompt for a source text; pass the result to yourself to generate a WIKI_DIFF
- `kirograph_wiki_apply_diff` — apply a WIKI_DIFF to create or update wiki pages
- `kirograph_wiki_search` — full-text search over wiki pages
- `kirograph_wiki_page` — retrieve the full content of a page by slug
- `kirograph_wiki_list` — list all pages with metadata
- `kirograph_wiki_lint` — health check: broken links, orphan pages, contradictions

**When to consult the wiki:**
- Before starting a complex feature or bug fix: `kirograph_wiki_search(query: "<topic>")`
- When the user references a concept you don't recognize from the code graph alone
- After `kirograph_context` returns wiki enrichments (pages above threshold score)

**When to update the wiki:**
- End of a session that produced durable knowledge (architecture decision, API contract, process)
- The ingest hook will remind you at agentStop if `enableWiki: true` is set

**Quick workflow:**
1. `kirograph_wiki_ingest` — get the prompt with SCHEMA + MANIFEST + your source text
2. Generate a `WIKI_DIFF` block (create/upsert/append per page)
3. `kirograph_wiki_apply_diff` — apply it; review any pending conflicts in the response

## Security

KiroGraph scans dependency manifests across 14 ecosystems for known vulnerabilities, performs
call-graph reachability analysis, tracks exploitation probability (EPSS), checks license
compliance, and monitors dependency staleness.

**Available tools:**
- `kirograph_security` — overview: dep count, CVE count, verdict breakdown, stale warnings
- `kirograph_vulns` — list CVEs with severity, EPSS score, reachability verdict, fix suggestion
- `kirograph_reachability` — deep-dive: call paths, entry points, affected layers for one CVE or package
- `kirograph_licenses` — list dependency licenses; flag policy violations (deny/warn by SPDX pattern)
- `kirograph_staleness` — identify outdated dependencies (staleness score 0.0–1.0)
- `kirograph_sbom` — export CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM for compliance/auditing
- `kirograph_vex` — export CycloneDX 1.5 VEX with reachability-derived analysis states
- `kirograph_vuln_add` — manually register a private/internal CVE not in public databases

**Proactive triggers — run `kirograph_security` when:**
- You or the user add/update/remove a dependency
- Before a production deploy or release branch cut
- The user asks about security, compliance, or "is it safe to upgrade X"
- `kirograph_context` surfaces a ⚠ Security warning in its output

**Interpreting verdicts:**
- `affected` — a call path exists from an entry point to the vulnerable code. Act on this.
- `not_affected` — no reachable path found, no unresolved imports. Strong signal: likely safe.
- `under_investigation` — traversal hit unresolved symbols (dynamic dispatch, reflection). Treat with caution.

**Interpreting EPSS scores** (shown by `kirograph_vulns`):
- `>= 0.5` — actively exploited or very likely to be. Patch immediately regardless of CVSS.
- `0.1 – 0.5` — elevated risk. Prioritize over low-EPSS vulns with higher CVSS.
- `< 0.1` — low exploitation probability. Use CVSS + reachability for triage.

**Recommended workflow:**
1. `kirograph_security` — get the big picture before diving in
2. `kirograph_vulns --verdict affected` — focus only on confirmed reachable CVEs
3. For each high-EPSS or high-CVSS result: `kirograph_reachability <cve>` to see exact call paths
4. `kirograph_licenses --policy` — check for license violations before shipping
5. `kirograph_staleness --threshold 0.5` — flag severely outdated dependencies
6. Fix, then `kirograph_vulns --refresh` to re-query OSV and confirm resolution
7. `kirograph_vex` / `kirograph_sbom` for compliance artifacts

**Staleness score guide:** 0.0 = current; 0.3+ = worth reviewing; 0.7+ = significantly behind.
A high staleness score alone is not a security issue, but old dependencies accumulate CVEs over time.
