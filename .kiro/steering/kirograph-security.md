# KiroGraph: Security Audit Workflow

Follow these steps for a structured security audit using the knowledge graph.
Activate this workflow before a release, after adding dependencies, or when asked to review security posture.

## Steps

### 1. Overview
```
kirograph_security()
```
Note: total dependencies, vulnerability count, verdict breakdown, stale warning count.

### 2. Triage reachable vulnerabilities
```
kirograph_vulns(verdict: "affected")
```
Focus only on confirmed reachable CVEs. Sort output by EPSS score (exploitation probability) first, then CVSS severity.

**Act immediately on:** EPSS >= 0.5 (actively exploited). Patch regardless of CVSS.
**Prioritize:** EPSS 0.1–0.5 over low-EPSS high-CVSS entries.
**Low urgency:** EPSS < 0.1 — use CVSS + reachability for triage.

### 3. Deep-dive reachability for critical CVEs
For each high-priority CVE from step 2:
```
kirograph_reachability(target: "<CVE-ID or package name>")
```
This shows: exact call paths from entry points, affected architectural layers, distinct path count.

- `affected` verdict with known entry points → fix this dependency
- `not_affected` → no reachable path, document and move on
- `under_investigation` → unresolved symbols, treat conservatively

### 4. Check for under-investigation CVEs
```
kirograph_vulns(verdict: "under_investigation")
```
For each: run `kirograph_reachability` to see what symbols are unresolved. If you can determine
the symbol is not called, you can downgrade to not_affected manually.

### 5. License compliance
```
kirograph_licenses(policy: true)
```
Review any DENY violations — these must be resolved before shipping.
WARN violations should be documented and approved by the team.

### 6. Dependency staleness
```
kirograph_staleness(threshold: 0.5)
```
Score guide: 0.3+ = worth reviewing, 0.7+ = significantly behind.
Cross-reference with step 2 results: stale + vulnerable = highest priority.

### 7. Refresh data if needed
If vulnerability data looks stale (flagged in step 1) or dependencies changed recently:
```
kirograph_vulns(refresh: true)
```

### 8. Export compliance artifacts
```
kirograph_sbom()   // Software Bill of Materials
kirograph_vex()    // Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange
```

## Interpretation Reference

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `affected` + EPSS >= 0.5 | Actively exploited, reachable | Patch immediately |
| `affected` + CVSS >= 9.0 | Critical, reachable | Patch this sprint |
| `affected` + CVSS 7.0–8.9 | High, reachable | Plan fix within 2 weeks |
| `not_affected` | No reachable path found | Document, no action needed |
| `under_investigation` | Reachability unclear | Manual review required |
| Stale >= 0.7 | Very outdated | Review for accumulated CVEs |
| License DENY | Policy violation | Must resolve before release |
